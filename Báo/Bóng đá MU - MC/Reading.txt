Manchester City avenged their FA Cup final defeat by Manchester United as Pep Guardiola’s side triumphed 7-6 on penalties after the Community Shield had finished level at Wembley.

Bernardo Silva levelled for the Blues in the final minute but then had City’s first spot-kick saved by Andre Onana to give United the advantage.

However, Ederson saved Jadon Sancho’s effort before veteran defender Jonny Evans fired over, allowing Manuel Akanji to secure victory in this competition for the first time since 2019 in front of 78,416.

Alejandro Garnacho thought he had given United victory nine minutes from time when he collected possession at the end of a flowing move deep into the City half, instigated by skipper Bruno Fernandes, and then drove a low shot into the bottom corner.

Silva’s initial bad-tempered response to that was to barge into Garnacho long after he had moved the ball on to earn himself a booking.

The Portuguese’s next intervention was far more positive. As young Norwegian Oscar Bobb was spinning into space by the goal-line, Silva was pulling onto makeshift left-back Facundo Pellistri at the far post. Hardly the tallest, Silva had enough spring and intuition to climb above the Uruguayan and head in the equaliser at the far post.

It set up a climax that triggered elation in the City ranks and disappointment among the United support, many of whom left well before the trophy presentation.

The thrilling ending was hardly in keeping with a sometimes stodgy occasion as both sides struggled to reach their highest levels.

Both sides hit the post. James McAtee did so in the first half when he seized on a wayward Lisandro Martinez pass. Marcus Rashford did the same in the second, when he sent Garnacho’s low cross against the base of the post with only Ederson to beat.
